Description: Perform the zFPKM transform on RNA-seq FPKM data. This algorithm is
	based on the publication by Hart et al., 2013 (Pubmed ID 24215113). Reference recommends
	using zFPKM >-3 to select expressed genes.  Validated with encode open/closed chromosome
	data.  Works well for gene level data using FPKM or TPM.  Does not appear to calibrate well
	for transcript level data.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.2)
