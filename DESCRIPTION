Description: Perform the zFPKM transform on RNA-seq FPKM data. This algorithm
    is based on the publication by Hart et al., 2013 (Pubmed ID 24215113). Reference
    recommends using zFPKM > -3 to select expressed genes. Validated with encode
    open/closed chromosome data. Works well for gene level data using FPKM or TPM.
    Does not appear to calibrate well for transcript level data.
